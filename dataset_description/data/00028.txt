  "description": "This dataset captures detailed records of a high-precision metal component manufacturing process carried out in an advanced industrial plant. Each batch represents a single production run where raw metal materials of varying types and weights are processed through multiple stages to fabricate finished parts. The process begins with the controlled preheating of raw materials to an optimum temperature to facilitate easier machining and forming. Operators are assigned by shifts, and machines are monitored for operational parameters such as welding current, voltage, and duration, which are critical for ensuring consistent joint quality. Cooling methods, selected based on material and product specifications, influence microstructural properties and surface finish, which are recorded meticulously. Post-machining, components undergo surface finishing treatments that may include polishing or coating applications; the thickness and uniformity of these coatings are tracked to ensure corrosion resistance and durability. Inspection procedures evaluate each part for defects, categorized by type and severity, guiding decisions on whether rework is required. Additional metadata such as energy consumption and emission levels provide insights into process efficiency and environmental impact. Once finalized, products are packaged with specific integrity criteria to prevent damage during shipment. The dataset also links manufacturing data with logistics through shipment date, customer details, and delivery status, enabling end-to-end traceability from raw materials to customer delivery in a complex supply chain."
