  "description": "This dataset captures comprehensive records of a multi-stage manufacturing process for producing high-precision mechanical parts used in the automotive industry. Each entry corresponds to a single production batch tracked from raw material intake through final packaging and dispatch. Production occurs across several lines, each equipped with specialized machinery monitored continuously for vibration, temperature, and power consumption to ensure optimal operating conditions. Raw materials, predominantly metal alloys, vary by type and batch, with parameters such as temperature and humidity recorded to assess their potential impact on process quality.\n\nThe manufacturing workflow is divided into three critical process stages, each with timing logged in seconds\u2014covering initial shaping, heat treatment, and final finishing. Operators document their involvement along with any maintenance activities performed on machines during or immediately before the batch runs. Environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and humidity are recorded in real-time to correlate with process performance.\n\nProduct quality is rigorously evaluated, with the defect count logged as well as a binary pass/fail indicator from quality control inspections. Output quantities and weight measurements provide insights into production yield and efficiency. Finished products are categorized by packaging type and weight, with logistical details including shipping mode, distance, and delivery time capturing end-to-end traceability.\n\nOperators can add free-text notes offering qualitative observations or incident reports, adding rich context beyond sensor and system data. This multi-dimensional dataset enables deep analysis of factors impacting manufacturing efficiency, product quality, machine health, and supply chain logistics, supporting data-driven improvements across the production lifecycle."
