  "description": "This dataset captures the detailed operational and quality parameters of an advanced multi-stage manufacturing process for producing polymer-based automotive components in batches. Each record corresponds to a single production batch handled during a specific shift on a given day. The process begins with input raw materials sourced from various suppliers and identified by unique RawMaterialBatch numbers. These materials are fed into high-precision injection molding machines (MachineID), operated by skilled operators (OperatorID) whose experience and training impact process variability. Critical process parameters such as Temperature, Pressure, Processing Time, and Speed are continuously recorded to monitor and control molding conditions for optimal polymer shaping. Following molding, parts undergo a controlled cooling phase to ensure material stability and dimensional accuracy. Various operational metrics including InputWeight and OutputWeight provide insights into material usage and yield efficiency. Throughout production, real-time energy consumption (EnergyConsumed_kWh) and lubricant levels are tracked to optimize resource utilization and machine health. Post-production, each batch is subjected to rigorous quality inspections that identify defect counts and types, scoring products via a FinalQualityScore metric. Data on rework and scrap weights help quantify losses and quality issues, while records of any maintenance activities (type and timing) assist in correlating machine health with product quality. External environmental factors like ambient temperature and humidity are also logged as potential influencers on process consistency. The combination of precise time stamps\u2014from production start through inspection\u2014enables detailed temporal analysis of setup durations and downtime occurrences. This richly featured dataset supports comprehensive analytics aimed at enhancing manufacturing efficiency, reducing defects, optimizing resource consumption, and informing predictive maintenance strategies in a highly dynamic industrial production environment."
