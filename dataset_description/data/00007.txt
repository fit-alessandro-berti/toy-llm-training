  "description": "This manufacturing process dataset captures detailed telemetry and operational data across the entire production lifecycle of advanced composite materials used in aerospace components. Each record corresponds to a single batch identified by BatchID and is associated with a specific ProductCode that defines the type of composite being processed. Secondary raw material traceability is ensured via RawMaterialBatch and MaterialType fields, tracking different resin systems, fiber types, and additives. \n\nThe process is highly automated but monitored continuously by operators identified by OperatorID, with their experience level recorded to assess human factors impacting yield and defect rates. Each batch has precise timestamped StartTime and EndTime to calculate CycleTime_sec, with environmental conditions logged such as ambient temperature and humidity, critical to resin curing quality.\n\nThe production involves thermal and pressure stages, so Temperature_C and Pressure_psi are recorded in real-time alongside machine-specific parameters like MachineID and VibrationLevel_mms which help to detect equipment anomalies early. LubricationLevel_ml and CleaningCycleCompleted flags indicate maintenance activities dedicated to minimizing downtime and maintaining product quality.\n\nAfter manufacturing, energy consumption is tracked per batch (EnergyConsumption_kWh) to optimize plant efficiency. Detailed quality control results (QualityCheckResult) and defect counts are logged, including ScrapWeight_kg and YieldPercentage to evaluate process efficiency. Any rework required is flagged explicitly and inspection notes provide qualitative feedback from quality engineers.\n\nThe final logistics information includes PackagingType, TransportMode, WarehouseLocation, CustomerOrderID, and planned ShippingDate to facilitate end-to-end supply chain integration. Downtime_min and MaintenancePerformed fields document unexpected interruptions and scheduled upkeep, critical for continuous improvement analyses. \n\nOverall, this comprehensive dataset supports granular analysis of manufacturing performance, enabling predictive maintenance, quality improvements, energy optimization, and traceability for highly regulated aerospace composite manufacturing processes."
