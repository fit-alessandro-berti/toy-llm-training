  "description": "This dataset captures detailed records of a multi-stage manufacturing process used to produce high-precision industrial components. Each entry corresponds to a single production batch, uniquely identified by the batch_id, and includes information about the production date and shift to account for operational variations. The product_type field differentiates between several product variants, each requiring specific processing parameters.\n\nRaw materials entering the process are tracked via the raw_material_lot and input_material_weight_kg fields, ensuring traceability and quality control. The manufacturing is carried out by automated machines, identified by machine_id, operated by trained personnel referenced by operator_id. Environmental conditions, such as ambient_humidity_percent and ambient_temperature_c, are logged continuously to monitor their impact on product quality.\n\nCritical process parameters including process_temperature_c, process_pressure_bar, and process_duration_min are recorded to maintain optimal production conditions. Machine health indicators like machine_vibration_level and energy_consumption_kwh provide insights into equipment performance and potential maintenance needs.\n\nQuality assurance is a key aspect represented by defect_count, defect_type, and quality_score, capturing both quantitative and qualitative measures of product integrity. Final product attributes such as final_product_weight_kg, packaging_type, and packaging_weight_g are noted before the product undergoes a final inspection, indicated by inspection_pass. If defects or deviations are detected, rework_required and rework_duration_min document corrective actions taken.\n\nThe dataset also traces the logistic side, including shipping_date, destination, and customer_order_id, linking manufacturing output directly to customer fulfillment. The economic dimension is covered by cost_per_unit_usd, enabling cost analysis and process optimization efforts.\n\nOverall, this dataset provides a comprehensive view of the manufacturing lifecycle, from raw material intake through process execution, quality control, and delivery, making it an invaluable resource for process improvement, predictive maintenance, and supply chain insights."
