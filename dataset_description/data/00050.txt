  "description": "This dataset captures detailed records from a state-of-the-art manufacturing process for producing high-precision industrial components used in aerospace and automotive sectors. Each record corresponds to a unique batch of products manufactured on a specific date and shift, allowing for detailed traceability. The manufacturing process begins with receiving raw materials, each traced by a lot number, and evaluated with a quality score based on impurity levels and batch homogeneity. Raw materials undergo a preprocessing stage involving controlled heating measured in temperature (\u00b0C) and time (minutes), preparing them for assembly. The assembly phase utilizes precisely measured quantities of multiple specialized components (A, B, and C) combined at designated assembly stations, tracked by station IDs and operators responsible to ensure consistency and efficiency. Multiple quality checks are performed throughout the process, each scored to monitor compliance with rigorous standards. When defects are detected, categorized by type and severity, the dataset records whether rework was required and logs the time spent on rework procedures. Post-assembly, final product weight is recorded and products are packaged using various packaging types suited for transport durability. Final inspection results indicate if the product passed quality standards before shipping. Energy consumption and CO2 emissions are logged for sustainability metrics. Shipping details include the target warehouse and associated customer order IDs, with lead times calculated from production to shipment. Overall, the dataset provides an exhaustive view of the manufacturing lifecycle to support optimization, quality control, sustainability assessment, and supply chain management."
