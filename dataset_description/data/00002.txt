  "description": "This dataset captures detailed production process metrics and quality control parameters from a multi-stage manufacturing plant specializing in high-precision polymer extrusion and molding. Each record corresponds to a single production batch, identified uniquely by Batch_ID, processed on a specific date and shift with traceability back to individual machine units and operators. Raw material inputs are tracked by lot number and material grade, ensuring full provenance and compliance with regulatory standards. Critical process variables monitored include input temperature and moisture percentage, processing time, pressure, and rotational speed, all of which directly influence polymer molecular alignment and product consistency. Energy consumption metrics provide insights into operational efficiency and sustainability targets. Output quantity and yield percentage quantify production success, while detailed defect tracking records defect types and counts identified during post-production inspection. The dataset also notes whether batches passed inspection or required rework, with associated rework time logged for continuous improvement analysis. Downtime is carefully documented with reasons, helping identify bottlenecks in equipment or supply chain constraints. Ambient environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity within the manufacturing area are included to assess their impact on process variability. Comprehensive quality scores and final product grading provide essential feedback loops, augmented by packaging types and storage conditions to safeguard product integrity during logistics. Finally, customer feedback scores collected post-shipment close the loop on product performance in the field, facilitating holistic data-driven optimization of the entire manufacturing lifecycle."
